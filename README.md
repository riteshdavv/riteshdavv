## 🚀 Projects  

### 🏆 Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2025, Drupal Association  
#### Appwrite Integration Module - Secure BaaS Integration for Modern Web Workflows

The project aimed to develop a robust, secure, and extensible Drupal module that integrates with Appwrite, **an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS)**. By bridging these platforms, the module will empower developers to build dynamic, serverless applications while leveraging Drupal’s powerful CMS capabilities.

🚀 **Features & Goals:**  
- ✅ Enabled **seamless login for over 100 users** by implementing secure **OAuth 2.0 authentication** between Appwrite and Drupal, integrating **GitHub and Google** flows to simplify cross-platform onboarding.
- ✅ Improved **media management efficiency by 40%** by integrating **Appwrite’s storage bucket API** with Drupal’s media system, allowing **real-time upload, retrieval**, and scoped access control of user-generated files.
- ✅ Reduced **data retrieval latency by 50%** by connecting **Appwrite’s document database** with Drupal, enabling **efficient storage and querying of structured content** and improving developer productivity.
